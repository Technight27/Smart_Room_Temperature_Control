# Smart_Room_Temperature_Control
Developed a smart automated fan speed controller using an Arduino UNO and DHT22 sensors for data collection. Implemented a Rule-Based approach with Fuzzy Logic (Mamdani Inference System) for coding. Data transmission to the ThingSpeak cloud server was facilitated by an ESP32 microcontroller.
